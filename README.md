# hello-world
Getting started, tutorial

I'm starting to transition into using more of the mainstream coding tools, for possible transition into a data science career. I use MATLAB extensively for data analysis in my lab work at Berkeley, but follow the general academic tendency of storing data in text files, and I tend to save new or multiple versions of my codes for every experiment. Goals are to start using GitHub to track changes to my codes better, and try to make them more use-friendly in general, as well as start doing my data analysis in Python, and learn to use databases using programs like mySQL. If things go well, ideally I will try to get some practice doing Kaggle projects, and perhaps apply for the Insight PhD to Data Science transition fellowship.

Cheers,
Marieke
